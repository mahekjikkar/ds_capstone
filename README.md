Entry Queue Manager:
Question : 

You need to build an entry queue manager for a stadium. There are N entry gates.
As people keep coming in, they can line up in any of the queues or switch queues
anytime if they think that will get them a quicker entry. The entry queue manager
helps them in making that decision by suggesting:
(i) the waiting time for the last person in the queue to enter through any gate
(assume that it takes p mins for a single attendee to enter any gate),
(ii) the particular queue number(s) where one should be switching.
The queue manager must be designed to minimize the time for M people to enter
the stadium. Each gate has an initial random assignment of M/2 people (a gate
may not have anyone assigned).
Comments:
● Please look at the changes.
● “Initial random assignment of M/2 people”: Half of the total number of
attendees (i.e., the capacity of the stadium) are already assigned to each
of the gates randomly (may not be equally distributed).
